1.Given an array of integers arr and a constant y, find the length of the largest subset such that the absolute difference between any two elements in the subset is greater than or equal to y.

Example: For the input arr = {-900, 1, 1, 2, 100, 101, 2, 4, 5, 10, 18, 20, 15} and y = 4, the expected output is 7.

One possible largest subset is {-900, 1, 100, 5, 10, 20, 15}, where the difference between any two elements in the subset is greater than or equal to 4.

2. Given an array of integers arr and a constant x, find the number of pairs (i, j) such that: i < j and arr[i] + arr[j] is divisible by x

Example: For the input arr = [3, 8, 2, 7, 1, 9] and x = 5. The valid pairs are (3, 7) , (8, 2) , (7, 8) and (1, 9) because their sums are divisible by 5.
So, the expected output would be 4.

3. Given an array of strings where each string consists of lowercase alphabets and the character '?', return a string that has the fewest '?' characters while matching all the given strings. The character '?' can be replaced with any lowercase alphabet to achieve a match. (The array consists of strings of same length)

Examples:

For the input array of strings ["a?c", "??c", "abc"], the expected output is "abc"
For the input array of strings ["adc", "??c", "abc"], the expected output is "a?c"

4.https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/
https://leetcode.com/problems/second-minimum-node-in-a-binary-tree/

 was able to code both of them but that approach was not the exact approach but a little different one. But I think it is not about problem-solving capabilities it is about THE CORRECT SOLUTION. So my tip would be to cram THE CORRECT SOLUTION from leetcode because the interviewer wants that crammed solution only.
