Round 3 (Technical Interview): My interview was scheduled on 11 September 2022. The interview was conducted in physical mode.  

At first, the interviewer asked me to introduce myself. After that, she introduced herself.  
Then she started explaining the first question. The question was based on Binary-Search.
 It was a non-standard question. At first, I told her about the brute force approach, and she looked satisfied and asked me to further optimize it. Then I told her the approach which was based on binary search. 
She asked me to dry-run the approach on 1 or 2 test cases. When she got an idea of my approach then she asked me to code it and later asked about the time complexity of the code.
 The interviewer looked satisfied and we moved to the next question.
The next question was based on a linked list.

For reference, I am attaching the link here: Detect and remove cycle in a linked list.

This time also, I started with brute force with some extra space. She asked me to optimize it. I told her about the slow and fast pointer approach and the intuition behind it. She asked me to code it. further, she asked about the time complexity. This time she also looked satisfied with my explanation.

At last, she asked if I had any questions for her. I asked her two questions and then the interview was over. The interview lasted for 50-55 minutes.

My interview started with the interviewer giving a brief introduction about himself and asking for mine.
I have told about my projects and my internship experiences. Later he asked me if I was comfortable with Binary trees. He asked me to solve this question, after I had said yes.

He asked me to explain the logic and then write the code. I was able to build logic, explain it to him, and was able to write code as well. He seemed satisfied.
Later he came up with this question and I was able to solve this problem completely.

s. They presented me with two DSA questions. One was about finding the Kth smallest/largest number, which I solved using queues, and the other was converting a number into Roman numerals. I was able to solve both questions efficiently, with time to spare.

1st Coding Question:

This was a variation of the Search in Rotated Sorted Array problem. The interviewer framed it as a scenario where a spinning wheel of numbers formed a rotated sorted array. I applied a modified binary search approach to solve it optimally in O(log n) time complexity.
2nd Coding Question:

The second problem involved finding the Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree. The task was to print the path between a source and destination node, which required identifying the common ancestor of both nodes. This was a classic tree traversal problem.
